Rebooked.com website
====================

Static page website built using [Cactus v3](https://github.com/koenbok/Cactus/tree/v3).


Notes
-----

- For build instructions, please review the Cactus documentation. Requires python.
- The files to deploy live in `.build` or `.deploy` after they've been built.
- I have a subscription to Typekit, which is where the Myriad fonts are coming from. We may want to subscribe to that through Rebooked, Inc.
